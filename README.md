JSON Explanation:
Javascript object notation
Any data that is returned from an endpoint is automatically converted to a JSON format.

Query parameters are a defined set of parameters attached to the end of a url.

To append query params to the end of a URL, a ‘?’ Is added followed immediately by a query parameter.
